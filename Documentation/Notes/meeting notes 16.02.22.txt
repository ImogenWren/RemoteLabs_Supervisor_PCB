2nd project

more modular

5v out
12v out
atmega328p
i2c bus out to raspberry pi

look for 8A buck converter

simplified




TODO:
1. PCB layout Finish. Extra Vout terminal 24v 12 & 5v. if space add an extra USB and DC output
	EMF Concerns? 
	Ground Plane on bottom
	Chunky tracks on top for power
	
2. buck conversion board simple PSU with I2c for generic experiments
3. microcontroller babysitter project for each experiment.
