# Remote Labs Supervisor PCB V1.0

## Project Brief - [Remote Labs Supervisor PCB V1.0]
Design a PCB to provide power to remote labs experiments, which involve students programming microcontrollers remotely. PCB should also provide a supervisory role, blocking actuation of experimental hardware if it is likely to cause damage to the equipment. <br> <br>

This allows students to upload their own code to a bare bones microcontroller, without risk of causing hardware damage or unsafe conditions. <br>
