# Remote Labs Supervisor PCB V2.0

Project Brief - [Remote Labs Supervisor PCB V2.0]
Design a PCB to provide power to remote labs experiments, which involve students programming microcontrollers remotely. PCB should also provide a supervisory role, blocking actuation of experimental hardware if it is likely to cause damage to the equipment.

This allows students to upload their own code to a bare bones microcontroller, without risk of causing hardware damage or unsafe conditions.
